# JQUERY

- jQuery is a Javascript library
- makes it easier to use Javascript
- most popular Javascript library. 
- four main parts: 
1. DOM nav / manipulations
2. Animations
3. Event Handling
4. AJAX (will discuss later) 
- How do we “use” jQuery? Include in HTML like vanilla JS files. 
- JS file contains all the functions that are predefined for you. You access them with the jQuery operator. 
- two ways to link file to HTML: 
1. locally: <scrip src=‘jQuery.’></script>
2. externally: CDN address of jQuery library
- jQuery **operator** = $
- jQuery operator = $.method. 
- 2 ways to use it:  $() and $.something. 
- $() is a function into which you pass selectors, as strings, as arguments. You will be returned a jQuery object. This object is *similar* to a NodeList.
